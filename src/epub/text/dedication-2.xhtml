</div>


<p class="center" style="font-size: 1.3em"><span class="smcap">To MAURICE BARING</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Maurice,—</span></p>

<p>I have dedicated to you two books: one was a book
‘On Nothing.’ This I dedicated to you because, being
on nothing, it dealt with what is better than the fullness
of life.</p>

<p>Another book I dedicated to you was the ‘Green
Overcoat,’ and this I dedicated to you because you had
written a play called the ‘Green Elephant,’ and we
thereby held communion in green things.</p>

<p>I now dedicate to you this book, because you also
have written a book upon Things That Come to Mind,
and this book may well turn into something of the
same sort. Yours was called ‘The Puppet Show of
Memory,’ and dealt with the things and people you had
seen and known. What mine will be called I do not
yet know, for I hold that a child should be born before
it is christened.</p>

<p>I have been led into this opinion by the action of an
acquaintance, who much disputed with his wife what
name the child should bear, it being not yet born. To
this choice they attached great issues; for they rightly
thought that a name determines a lifetime much more
than does a horoscope, and for this reason they consulted
no astrologer. First they explored the grander
sounds, names of dominion and power. They considered
Esmeralda, Ruhala, Semiramis, Darumdibaba,
and Rimbomba, as also Haulteclaire, following the
noise of pomps and wars. Wearying of this, the
glamour of strangeness seized them, and they attempted
Pelagia, Sonia, Mehitabel, Oona, Célimène,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>Mamua and Berengarde, Machuska, Gounor, and
Zaire; but these seemed, upon a second reading, affected:
as indeed they were. So they fell into childishness,
and wallowed in gardening, reciting Pansy,
Daisy, Rose, Violet, Pimpernel, and even Forget-me-Not,
which led them into the Furor Hebraicus, and
such terms as Miriam, Lilith, Deborah, Eve, Mizraim,
Sheba, and the rest—very unsuitable; from which
they reacted to mere abstractions, such as Mercy,
Peace, Charity, Grace, and what not. But these seeming
insipid, they fell maundering after a donnish fashion
and dared consider Æthelburga, Fristhwith, Ealswitha,
and other abominations, till an angel compelled
them to desist and they were driven to the solid path
of the queens, and advanced Maud, Adelaide, Matilda,
Elizabeth, Guinevere, Anne, and jibbed at
Jezebel. Next they ran wild and careered through
Tosca, Faustine, Theodora, Athalie, Antigone, Medea,
Pasiphaë, and many others. Finally, they perched,
she upon the name Astarte, but he upon the, to my
mind, lovelier word, Cytherea. They both mean the
same thing, only one was a well-modelled Greek, and
the other a horrible Hittite. It was the woman who
wanted Astarte, and the man who wanted Cytherea;
so the child was to be called Astarte, and she was not
even allowed to have the second name of Cytherea.</p>

<p>All that was on Thursday, the 2d June. On the 13th,
being a Monday, in the early afternoon, the child was
born, and was a boy.</p>

<p>There was no more discussion upon its name, because
its uncle, a rich man, was called James. So the
boy was James, and there was an end of it.</p>

<p>I have been led on, as you see, but the essence of
this book is that it shall be a sailing through the seas of
the years, that is, a flight through the airs of time, or,
again, a leading on and a passage through the vales of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>life: now culling this sour fruit, now that poisonous
herb, and now again this stinging plant, which I had
thought to be innocuous.</p>

<p>For whether I should write, Maurice, a book of
reminiscences or of wandering, or of extravagances or
of opinions, or of conclusions, or of experiences, I could
not make up my mind after a cogitation of three weeks
and four days, which occupied the whole of my remaining
faculties between the town of Blois, upon the
Loire, and the town of Châlons, upon the Marne, my
journey from the one to the other being taken this very
year circuitously, in the company of a Bear, by way of
Bayonne, where the bayonet, Rosalie, was first made;
Saint John at the foot of the Pass, where they boil
crayfish in white wine; Roncesvalles, where Roland
died, and I nearly did; Burguete, where they charge
too much and where the kitchen smoke goes out
through the middle of the roof; Pamplona, the only
permanent thing Pompey ever did; Saragossa, which
never changes; Reus, where they spin cotton; Tarragona,
which is biding its time; Barcelona, which got
there first; Puycerda, and, after that, the Gorges of the
Tet.</p>

<p>I was by this time a long way from Blois, but I had
come to no conclusion on the name of my book, and
my mind was still like one of those conferences to which
the parliamentarians of various countries travel at our
expense from time to time, and are there delivered
of heavy speeches without meaning, which make one
think of a corpulent elderly man groaning across a
ploughed clay field after a week’s rain in the dark of
the moon. At Nîmes I had not decided what to call the
book, nor down in a valley of the Cévennes, nor at
Lyons, nor in the Jura, nor in the Vosges, nor in Strasbourg;
until at last I came to Châlons, as I have said.
And, sitting down there to a meal in the hotel very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>finely called ‘The House of the High Mother of God,’
I still remained undecided. And I am so, to this day.</p>

<p>I cannot make it a book of reminiscences, because I
can remember nothing for more than about two days,
and also because I will not write about my contemporaries
for fear of offending them. They are very good
fellows, they have no particular characters or talents,
they do nothing lasting, they are a generation of saltless
butter with too much skim milk about it, there is
little to say about them, and almost anything one says
gives the little fellows offence. I would not call it
‘Opinions,’ because I have none either, only convictions;
and if I called it ‘Convictions’ I might be misunderstood.
I tell you I do not know what to call this
book, but I am dedicating it to you because it has at
least this parallel with your work that it is all about
things that have passed through my mind.</p>

<p>Indeed, the naming of a book has always seemed to
me a thing fastidious in both senses; that is, both a
thing wearisome and a thing of picking and choosing.
I am not quite sure that books ought to be named at
all. If they were numbered, like the streets in America,
they would be very much easier to catalogue and
shelf (or shelve) and remember the places of. Thus
your next book or so might be ‘Baring 32,’ and this
‘Belloc 106.’ And why not? It would in no way diminish
their souls, their connotations. Cannot a man be
head over ears in love with Number 15, Parham
Street, and sick of 30, Tupton Square? I can!</p>

<p>Numbers, I say, leave us free to give personality
and emotions to things. An anniversary is but a
numbered day in a month, yet it shakes a man more
than any feast name.</p>

<p>So should it be with books. When they are named,
they give a false indication; moreover, the vast crowd
of books that are poured out in this our day like fugitives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>from a plague-stricken city is so immense that
the discovery of a new title is impossible. However, it
will have a title before I have done, stap me, and it is
dedicated to you.</p>

<p>At this point I ought to end; but, as I have already
told you, it is in the very character of this book, of its
essence, nature, and personality, that it has only an
accidental beginning, no real end, and nothing in
particular between the two. It is like those rivers of
the Middle West which trickle out of a marsh, and then
wander aimless, without banks or shape, mere wetnesses,
following the lowest land until they reach the
shapeless Mississippi, and at last the flats and mud of
a steaming sea.</p>

<p>What a book!...</p>

<p>My mind now suggests to me (for my mind is separate
from myself, and may properly be regarded as no
more than an inconsequent companion) that I should
do very well not to cut off the Dedication from the rest
of the Opus. The putting of a dedication separately
from a book has something about it of form; and form
is just what I have to avoid. I am to wander at large,
setting down such things as pass before my eyes of
memory, leaving out pretty well all that is of importance
(reserving that for posthumous publication), and
doing no more than present this, that, or the other, of
ephemeral things. For there comes a time in life after
which a man discovers no more, has lost through the
effect of the years the multitude of what he possessed
both within and without, can only repeat phrases or
decisions already well worn. He is fixed, sterilised,
hardened, and has nothing left to say; that is the
moment in which he is expected to set down, for the
benefit of others, the full treasury of what was once
his soul.</p>

<p>Some two to five years ago there was an outburst of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>books in England which I myself labelled (and, I think,
justly) ‘The Cads’ Concert.’ These were books in
which men set down their connection with their fellows,
giving each by name familiarly, purported to publish
diaries which they had never kept, maligned the dead,
insulted the living, and lied impudently upon both.
They had a great sale, had these books, because they
brought in rich or otherwise important men and
women, known already by newspapers vaguely to the
readers of such books, so that those readers had from
‘The Cads’ Concert’ a faint reflection of High Life.</p>

<p>It was something quite new in the history of letters,
and had, I am glad to say, a very short life. I do not
propose to add one more vileness to that nasty little
list.</p>

<p>How then should I approach this task which has
been set me of writing down, in the years between
fifty and sixty, some poor scraps of judgment and
memory? I think I will give it the name of a Cruise;
for it is in the hours when he is alone at the helm,
steering his boat along the shores, that a man broods
most upon the past, and most deeply considers the
nature of things. I think I will also call it by the name
of my boat, the Nona, and give the whole book the
title ‘The Cruise of the Nona,’ for, in truth, the Nona
has spent her years, which are much the same as mine
(we are nearly of an age, the darling, but she a little
younger, as is fitting), threading out of harbours,
taking the mud, trying to make further harbours, failing
to do so, getting in the way of more important
vessels, giving way to them, taking the mud again,
waiting to be floated off by the tide, anchoring in the
fairway, getting cursed out of it, dragging anchor on
shingle and slime, mistaking one light for another,
rounding the wrong buoy, crashing into other people,
and capsizing in dry harbours. It seemed to me, as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>considered the many adventures and misadventures of
my boat, that here was a good setting for the chance
thoughts of one human life; since all that she has done
and all that a man does make up a string of happenings
and thinkings, disconnected and without shape,
meaningless, and yet full: which is Life.</p>

<p>Indeed, the cruising of a boat here and there is very
much what happens to the soul of a man in a larger
way. We set out for places which we do not reach, or
reach too late; and, on the way, there befall us all
manner of things which we could never have awaited.
We are granted great visions, we suffer intolerable
tediums, we come to no end of the business, we are
lonely out of sight of England, we make astonishing
landfalls—and the whole rigmarole leads us along
nowhither, and yet is alive with discovery, emotion,
adventure, peril, and repose.</p>

<p>On this account I have always thought that a man
does well to take every chance day he can at sea in the
narrow seas. I mean, a landsman like me should do so.
For he will find at sea the full model of human life:
that is, if he sails on his own and in a little craft suitable
to the little stature of one man. If he goes to sea
in a large boat, run by other men and full of comforts,
he can only do so being rich, and his cruise will be the
dull round of a rich man. But if he goes to sea in a
small boat, dependent upon his own energy and skill,
never achieving anything with that energy and skill
save the perpetual repetition of calm and storm,
danger undesired and somehow overcome, then he will
be a poor man, and his voyage will be the parallel of
the life of a poor man—discomfort, dread, strong
strain, a life all moving. What parallel I shall find in
the action of boats for a man of the middle sort, neither
rich nor poor, I cannot tell. Perhaps the nearest would
be the travel at a fixed price upon a steamer from one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>port not of the passenger’s choosing to another not of
his choosing, but carried along, ignorant of the sea
and of the handling of the vessel, and having all the
while no more from the sea than a perpetual, but not
very acute, discomfort, and with it a sort of slight uncertainty,
which are precisely the accompaniments
throughout life of your middle sort of man.</p>

<p>So I have given this book a name: ‘The Cruise of the
Nona.’ Had I called it ‘The Cargo,’ I might be nearer
my intention. At any rate, I am now off to sail the
English seas again, and to pursue from thought to
thought and from memory to memory such things as
have occupied one human soul, and of these some will
be of profit to one man and some to another, and most,
I suppose, to none at all.</p>
